##     Added set -- to clear passed in arguments
##  17-Aug-2010 (thich01)
##     Added quit op to allow jam to stop building on error by default. Changed
##     response text to make it more clear.

# This is a simple script to help you run the build with less overhead.
# It will automatically set up your environment and run the build.
# It will log all logs to a timestamped log file.

#TODO
# - add online help
# - add automatic execution of sep tests
# - add automatic packaging 
# - add cleanup and forced rebuild options (jam clean with -c) (jam force with -a)
# - add some additional sanity checks as issues are uncovered

Usage: -a to force a rebuild (i.e. jam -a)
       -c to clean a build (i.e. jam clean)
       -g to compile with extra debugging information
       -q to turn off the jam -q option, which will make jam complete the whole process, even when encountering an error.
       -h for this help text.
